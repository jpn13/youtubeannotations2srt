# Youtube Annotations to SubRip .srt file format

## Usage

Download the read2.xml with the annotations in it from Youtube, for example with the help of a cache viewer plugin for your browser. Install XMLStarlet. It is used for parsing the annotations file.

Call the script with read2.xml as parameter:
$ ./youtubeannotations2srt.sh read2.xml

The result should be a read2.srt in the same directory.

I updated the script to make it work for my use case.
